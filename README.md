# fastapi_assignment

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

    Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
    Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
    Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
    Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
    Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
    Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
